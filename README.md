## Design
The **_Welcome Page_** was designed to be user-friendly and look aesthetically pleasing and simple.

<br /> The **_Makeup Artists_** and **_Services_** pages show all the relevant information, like a description for the makeup artist, a photo example of their makeup style, the price and their contact information.

<br /> I created this app to explore the development process of mobile apps and also because I was curious about working with XAML and using concepts like Data Binding and asynchronous programming. 😊 Thanks for checking it out !
